### Elastic Stack

#### About this repository...
You want to expect things related ELK that include:<br>
- Elasticsearch 
- Logstash
- Monitoring a fleet of servers, using Heartbeat
<br>

Note that this repository is about "how you better manage(or operate)" the solution,<br>
as opposed to how to query. 

Each script in directory contains the information about:
- query
- automation 
- configuration details
and so on. <br><br>

For heartbeat, it was designed to monitor the health of entire servers(kafka, redis, elasticsearch)
